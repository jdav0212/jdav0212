### Hi there 👋

<!--
👋 Hi! I'm Jack Davis, a recent data science graduate passionate about turning data into actionable insights. 📊

🎓 I have recently obtained my Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Data Science and Information Systems from the University of Sydney. It was here where I honed my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and statistics. Now, I'm on a journey to apply what I've learned and explore the fascinating world of data science through personal projects.

💼 During my studies, I gained hands-on experience working on projects that involved predictive modeling, data visualization, and statistical testing. I'm excited to continue this journey by tackling real-world problems and contributing to the data science community.

🚀 My GitHub repository is where you'll find my personal data science projects. From predictive modeling to data storytelling, I'm eager to learn and share my insights with others. Feel free to explore my work, provide feedback, or collaborate on exciting projects together!

📚 Outside of data science, I'm passionate about travel, freediving, and brazillian jiu jitsu. I believe that diverse experiences and perspectives enrich our problem-solving abilities.

🌟 Feel free to reach out, share your thoughts, or explore my projects. I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations.
